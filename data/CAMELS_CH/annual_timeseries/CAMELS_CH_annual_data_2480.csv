# gauge_id=2480, Land cover attributes as area percentages based on the CORINE land cover databases by the European Copernicus Land Monitoring Service: 1990, 2000, 2006, 2012 and 2018. The years in between were interpolated by linear regression. In 1990, only areas outside Switzerland were covered by clc_1990, therefore only catchments with more then 95% data in clc_1990 were calculated. glaciers source: Swiss Glacier Inventory 1973/2016 and Paul et al, 2020. glacier_mass = glacier_volume*850[kg/m3].
