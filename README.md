Hy<sup>2</sup>DL is a python library to create Hybrid Hydrological Models for rainfall-runoff prediction, by combining DL methods with process based models. Specifically, the DL methods act as dynamic parameterizations for process-based conceptual models.

The idea of the repository is to have 'easy' to understand codes and to introduce new users to hybrid models. Because of this, we decided to sacrifice some code modularity to gain interpretability. The main codes are presented as jupyter notebooks.The logic of the code is heavily based on Neural Hydrology. For a more flexible, robust and modular implementation of deep learning method in hydrological modeling we advice the use of Neural Hydrology.

## Structure of the repository:

- **data**: Information necessary to run the codes. The CAMELS-GB and/or CAMELS-US datasets should be added here.
- **aux_functions**: auxiliary functions to run the codes
- **benchmarks**: Information from other studies that was used to benchmark our models
- **conceptual_models**: Present the codes to calibrate basin-wise process-based hydrological model. The calibration routines are based on the SPOTPY library (https://spotpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The process-based models are used as baselines to compare the performance of the hybrid models.
- **datasetzoo**: codes to process the CAMELS-GB and CAMELS-US dataset and incorporate them to the models.
- **experiments**: JupyterNotebooks to run the experiments
- **modelzoo**: codes of the different models that can be used
- **results**: Folder where the results generated by all the codes will be stored.

## Dependencies
The packages used to run the codes are indicated at the beginning of each notebook. It must be considered that the codes for the data-driven models run better in GPU, therefore a PyTorch version that supports GPU should be installed!

- If you want to reproduce the experiments of this paper, run the scripts: Hybrid_LSTM_SHM.ipynb, Hybrid_LSTM_Bucket.ipynb, Hybrid_LSTM_NonSense.ipynb, LSTM_CAMELS_GB.ipynb and LSTM_CAMELS_US.ipynb located in the path Hy2DL/experiments/.
- If you want to reproduce the figures without re-running the experiments, copy the files located in the result folder of the repository https://zenodo.org/records/11103634 and paste them into Hy2DL/results/. Then run the notebook Results_Analysis.ipynb.
