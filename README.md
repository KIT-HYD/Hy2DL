Hy<sup>2</sup>DL is a python library to create Hybrid Hydrological Models for rainfall-runoff prediction, by combining DL methods with process based models. Specifically, the DL methods act as dynamic parameterizations for process-based conceptual models.

The idea of the repository is to have 'easy' to understand codes and to introduce new users to hybrid models. Because of this, we decided to sacrifice some code modularity to gain interpretability. The main codes are presented as jupyter notebooks.

## Structure of the repository:

- **data**: Information necessary to run the codes (refer to https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8289409)
- **ERA5_Land_Processing**: Script to preprocess the ERA5-Land data if one wants to extract basin-wise soil moisture information. The original scripts were taken from Less (https://github.com/tommylees112/neuralhydrology/blob/pixel/notebooks/05b_preprocess_era5.ipynb), and slightly modified to fit our purposes.
- **Model_Conceptual**: Present the codes to calibrate basin-wise process-based hydrological models using three different methods: gradient descent (gd), Differential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (dream) and Shuffled Complex Evolution (sce). For the last 2 calibration methods, we used the SPOTPY libraty (https://spotpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The process-based models are used as baselines to compare the performance of the hybrid models.
- **Model_DataDriven**: Present the codes to create a Regional rainfall-runoff models using a LSTM network. The data-driven model is used as a baseline to compare the performance of the hybrid models. 
- **Model_Hybrid**: Present the codes to create a Regional rainfall-runoff model by combining data-driven techniques with process-based hydrological models. In this case the data-driven method is used as a dynamic parameterization of the process-based models.
- **results**: Folder where the results generated by all the codes will be stored.

## Dependencies
The packages used to run the codes are indicated at the beginning of each notebook. It must be considered that the codes for the data-driven and hybrid models are created to run in GPU, therefore a PyTorch version that supports GPU should be installed! For the optimization of the conceptual models using gradient descent, the standard version (CPU) of PyTorch is enough.
